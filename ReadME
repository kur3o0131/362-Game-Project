Game Overview
This project is a 2D top-down, turn-based RPG built in Unity. You explore an overworld (starting in the Town scene) and encounter enemies. When the player collides with an enemy, the game transitions into a separate BattleScene, where combat plays out using a turn-based system with a player party and a companion.
